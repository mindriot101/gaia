## Crossmatch SWASP IDs with GAIA

Check for matches between SuperWASP and GAIA with `queryGaia.py`. If the IRFM theta value is known for the targets, then the stellar radius is estimated using the quation below. The IRFM values used in SuperWASP are measured by Barry Smalley at the University of Keele.

```
â–¶ python queryGaia.py -h
usage: queryGaia.py [-h] [--theta THETA] [--radius RADIUS] swasp_id

positional arguments:
  swasp_id         swasp_id to cross match with GAIA. This can also be a path
                   to a text file containing a swasp_id and IRFM theta pair per line.
                   If theta is unknown, insert a minus number on each line instead.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --theta THETA    IRFM theta value (mas). If supplying swasp_ids in a text file put
                   the corresponding theta value on the same line as the
                   swasp_id separated by a space. Insert a minus number if theta is
                   unknown
  --radius RADIUS  search radius in arcsec
```

## Estimate Stellar Radius

Notes from Andrew Collier Cameron on estimating stellar radii using theta from IRFM and GAIA parallaxes (units are in mas).

```python
r_star = 214.9*(theta/2.)/parallax
```
